Bugs: Enemy spawning in same location
Fixes: check location for sprites and moving them a few spaces away making sure they do not go off 
screen

Bugs: Enemy may appear in similar location multiple times
Fixes: allow 2 sprites to be created together, but spliting them between the screen.

Bugs: Enemy continue moving even after game has been paused
Fixes: Disable movements of all entities, but storing the movement, then reaasigning them when game 
continues, and set the time back.

Bug: Enemy appearing delay on game restart
Fixes: Resetting the level on new game

Bug: player automatically looses life without colliding with enemy
Fixes: Moved life reduction to the colliding detection method
