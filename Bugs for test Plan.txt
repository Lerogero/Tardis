Bugs: Enemy spawning in same location
Fixes: check location for sprites and moving them a few spaces away making sure they do not go off screen

Bugs: Enemy may appear in similar location multiple times
Fixes: allow 2 sprites to be created together, but spliting them between the screen.

Bugs: Enemy continue moving even after game has been paused
Fixes: Disable movements of all entities, but storing the movement, then reaasigning them when game continues, and set the time back.
